# Ground State and Excited State of H2 Molecule using VQE and VQD

Quantum computing holds the promise of revolutionizing many fields, and one of the most exciting applications is in computational chemistry. Traditional methods for simulating molecular systems become computationally intractable as the size of the system increases. Quantum computers offer a potential solution to this problem by exploiting the quantum properties of matter to efficiently simulate molecular behavior.

In this notebook, we will employ two quantum algorithms, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), to find the ground state and excited state of the H2 molecule.
